    <title>The True Taste of Salt</title>

Before we end this, it is finally time to shine some praise onto water. Water dissolves salt, which is frequently observed during everyday actions. However, what exactly gives table salt its saltiness? (Hint: table salt by itself has no flavor to the human tongue). According to <a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/k12/snapshotday/activities/2011/Classroom%20HS%20activity/chloride%20conversion/Chloride%20and%20Salinity.pdf"> a Columbia University report,</a> salt only tastes salty to the human tongue because human's saliva (which is partly composed of water), dissolves the salt particles into Na+ and Cl- ions. Subsequently, it is the Cl- free-floating ions that posess a "salty" taste that we perceive comes from the salt crystals. Isn't that incredible? So the next time you reach for the salt shaker, be sure to thank the existence of the great water molecule for giving food its extra flavor kick, filling our lives with more meaning.
