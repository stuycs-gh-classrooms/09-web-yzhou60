<h2>Salt's Inseparable Companion</h2>
<p>When we taste something salty, we usually attribute it to the ionic salt compound, sodium chloride (or NaCl). However, that is only part of the story. NaCl as a compound has 0 taste, so if we were able to “taste” true NaCl compounds, we would not be grateful for having added them to a dish.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, it is the sodium and chloride ions (charged particles) that have a “salty” taste. It is believed that human mouths have developed specialized sodium and/or chloride ion channels that help notify us of salinity. However, sodium chloride is an extremely stable compound, and breaking it apart into lone ions would require tremendous amounts of energy… unless…</p>
<p>Yes, water dissolves NaCl! Thus, we are able to taste the ions simply because the water in our saliva automatically does the breaking-apart job for us! Water is the true hero of the day, as it turns out. So, the next time you grab a bag of chips and praise just how perfectly salted it is, be sure to thank water for being the helpful and inseparable sidekick to delight your taste buds.</p>
