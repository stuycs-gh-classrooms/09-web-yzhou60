So you have learned that water is virtually not compressible. Fine, that isn't life-changing or whatever. However, what about if water is truly wet? If it isn't, what exactly causes YOU to feel wet when you touch water?! According to <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/is-water-wet#:~:text=Most%20scientists%20define%20wetness%20as,liquids%20can%20be%20considered%20wet."> sciencefocus.com,</a> water by itself is not wet. However, how hydrophobic (or water-repelling) a surface it comes into contact with largely determines how "wet" that substance feels as water comes into contact with it. Thus, oils and wax paper will "feel" not-really-wet if they could have feelings, while humans' water-attracting skin largely causes us to suffer in misery when get soaked in a sudden unexpected thunderstorm.
