<h2>How Wet Is Water?</h2>
<p>Where do we even begin… take this example: if someone can make you feel annoyed easily, they probably are a rather annoying person. So, where does water lie? It can make you feel that wet feeling, but it is really just a cluster of tightly-spaced molecules moving together. If water is wet, does that mean molecules can be wet? But then which molecule transferred the wetness to the others?! But then, if water isn't wet, does that mean that the Earth is dry?!</p>
<p>Actually, there is a much simpler scientific explanation for the wet phenomenon. They define the wetness sensation as an aftermath of water molecules, when making contact with any surface. It is practically the same as a feeling when a solid object drops on you, but because water is mobile, you unfortunately feel the moving “wetness.” As the water is able to make continuous contact with the human skin, the wetness is essentially the feeling of not being able to get rid of the water molecules!</p>
