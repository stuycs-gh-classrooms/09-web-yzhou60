    <title>Is Water Compressible?</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
Indeed, a question we have all wondered. You can compress gas. You cannot compress solids. So, where do liquids, and specifically, liquid water, lie in all of this? Various scientific organizations have published findings on this, such as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjf5fey_Z6EAxWDtokEHYk-BigQFnoECA8QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usgs.gov%2Fspecial-topics%2Fwater-science-school%2Fscience%2Fwater-compressibility&usg=AOvVaw0-SIz5nmA3D-dEZ4v7Fgwz&opi=89978449"> this one</a> by USGS. The conclusion? Water is virtually incompressible in any environment our brain could in any sense comprehend! Isn't it a bit alerting that it is sharing this trait with solids...? So were we supposed to chew liquid water the entire time to prevent digestive tract issues?
