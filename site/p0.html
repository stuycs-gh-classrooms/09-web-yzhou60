<h2>Water Compressibility</h2>
<p>Water is practically incompressible under any conditions we could possibly imagine. On a molecular level, water molecules are fairly close to each other in liquid phase, and forcing them any closer will require a lot of force. Think: if the molecules of water are completely immovable and slammed into each other, you have created ice. Thus, the closeness in distance between water molecules in liquid phase makes them virtually impossible to compress under any possible Earthly conditions.</p>
