<h2> Intro to Water </h2>
<p>
We drink it everyday to survive, but what are some of the more interesting properties of water that truly makes it... well, water? According to <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/States_of_Matter/Properties_of_Liquids/Unusual_Properties_of_Water"> Unusual Properties of Water,</a>
certain properties of the dihydrogen monoxide molecule is truly unique to itself. Read below to learn more about the hidden miracles of water!

<h2> Section 1: Is Water Compressible? </h2>
<p>
You can compress gas. You cannot compress solids. So, where do liquids, and specifically, liquid water, lie in all of this? Various scientific organizations have published findings on this, such as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjf5fey_Z6EAxWDtokEHYk-BigQFnoECA8QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usgs.gov%2Fspecial-topics%2Fwater-science-school%2Fscience%2Fwater-compressibility&usg=AOvVaw0-SIz5nmA3D-dEZ4v7Fgwz&opi=89978449"> this one</a> by USGS. The conclusion? Water is virtually incompressible in any environment our brain could in any sense comprehend! Isn't it a bit alerting that it is sharing this trait with solids...? So were we supposed to chew liquid water the entire time to prevent digestive tract issues?
</p>

<h2> Section 2: Is Water Wet? </h2>
<p>
So you have learned that water is virtually not compressible. Fine, that isn't life-changing or whatever. However, what about if water is truly wet? If it isn't, what exactly causes YOU to feel wet when you touch water?! According to <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/is-water-wet#:~:text=Most%20scientists%20define%20wetness%20as,liquids%20can%20be%20considered%20wet."> sciencefocus.com,</a> water by itself is not wet. However, how hydrophobic (or water-repelling) a surface it comes into contact with largely determines how "wet" that substance feels as water comes into contact with it. Thus, oils and wax paper will "feel" not-really-wet if they could have feelings, while humans' water-attracting skin largely causes us to suffer in misery when get soaked in a sudden unexpected thunderstorm.

<h2> Section 3: Is Salt (NaCl) Truly Salty? </h2>
<p>
Before we end this, it is finally time to shine some praise onto water. Water dissolves salt, which is frequently observed during everyday actions. However, what exactly gives table salt its saltiness? (Hint: table salt by itself has no flavor to the human tongue). According to <a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/k12/snapshotday/activities/2011/Classroom%20HS%20activity/chloride%20conversion/Chloride%20and%20Salinity.pdf"> a Columbia University report,</a> salt only tastes salty to the human tongue because human's saliva (which is partly composed of water), dissolves the salt particles into Na+ and Cl- ions. Subsequently, it is the Cl- free-floating ions that posess a "salty" taste that we perceive comes from the salt crystals. Isn't that incredible? So the next time you reach for the salt shaker, be sure to thank the existence of the great water molecule for giving food its extra flavor kick, filling our lives with more meaning.
