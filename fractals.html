Fractals Reimagined!
</p>

<p>This is the basic koch curve below</p>

<p>This reimagining of the koch curve</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>This is the initial sierpenski triangle</p>

<p>This reimagining of the sierpenski triangle has the turtle put the pen up each time when it is drawing the third case of the sierpenski triangle, creating an interestingly non-symmetric design that resembles a video game level.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>This is a bland tree</p>

<p>Following a reimagining, the color of the tree is now brown, and the width steadily decreases by a factor of 0.9 everytime you move up a depth. Furthermore, a random number between 0 and 5 is added to the length of each line/branch, allowing for more diversified branch lengths. This creates a more realistic resemblance of a tree.</p>
