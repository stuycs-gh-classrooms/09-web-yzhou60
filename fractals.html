Fractals Reimagined!
</p>

<p>This is the basic koch curve below</p>

<p>This reimagining of the koch curve. In this case, at each depth, the length of the koch "line" is multipled by a random factor of 1 or 2. Furthermore, the pen color of the turtle becomes blue once depth increases beyond `. This creates a slightly more unique pattern while still retaining the overall shape.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>This is the initial sierpenski triangle</p>

<p>This is a reimagining of the sierpenski triangle, with the following modifications:
<ol>
<li>The color of the turtle's pen has been changed to brown once the depth increased beyond 1.</li>
<li>As the turtle put the pen up each time when it is drawing the third case of the sierpenski triangle.</li>
<li>The turtle puts the pen back down each time the third case is done.</li>
</ol>
This creates an interestingly non-symmetric design that resembles a video game level.
</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>This is a bland tree</p>

<p>Following a reimagining, the following changes have been made:
<ol>
<li>The color of the tree is now brown.</li>
<li>The width steadily decreases by a factor of 0.9 everytime you move up a depth.</li>
<li>A random number between 0 and 5 is added to the length of each line/branch, allowing for more diversified branch lengths.</li>
</ol>
Overall, this creates a more realistic resemblance of a tree.
